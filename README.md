# PSR (Partible State Replication) for VxWorks

Hello and welcome to the somewhat humble abode of PSR - Partible State Replication. It's a one-man show here, so expect the charm of a solo project (or even much worse, since it has been done in haste to test this concept)!

## What's PSR All About?

PSR is a daring little project implemented for VxWorks, aiming to explore the vast universe of state replication. It's a bit like trying to build a spaceship in your backyard - ambitious, a bit quirky, but full of potential.

### A One-Person Orchestra ðŸŽ»

This entire project is the brainchild of a single developer (yours truly). So, when you stumble across shortcuts or "creative" coding solutions, remember it's a solo journey. I've worn many hats to bring PSR to life, and each line of code has its own story.

### Disclaimer: Proceed with Caution ðŸš§

Embarking on a journey with PSR? That's brave! Just a heads-up: use it at your own risk. It's an experimental project, after all. If things go south, we're here in spirit but not in liability.

### Introducing VSR-QC (View Stamped Replication - Quorum Connected)

Nestled within PSR, you'll find our prototype implementation of VSR-QC. It's our attempt at achieving consensus in a distributed system - think of it as a diplomatic effort to maintain order amongst independent entities.

### Forthcoming Paper ðŸ“œ

There's a paper on the horizon that delves into the nitty-gritty of the PSR architecture. It's crafted with care (and a bit of caffeine) to provide insights into what makes PSR tick.
